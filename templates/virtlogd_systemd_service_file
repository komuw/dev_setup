# TODO: we have hardcoded the virtlogd path. This path is likely to change.
# We should ideally use something like `$(which virtlogd)`; but that aint working as of now.
# Idea: run `find /nix -name "*virtlogd*.service*"` all we need to do is symlink the virtlogd.service file that we find
# That service file comes with the `ExecStart` set to point to the correct virtlogd
ExecStart=/nix/store/nllfj0wwvw2f7146gplqh9db1vk8j5k9-libvirt-7.0.0/bin/virtlogd
ExecReload=/bin/kill -USR1 $MAINPID

# Need to have at least one file open per guest (eg QEMU
# stdio log), but might be more (eg serial console logs)
# A common case is OpenStack which often has up to 4 file
# handles per guest.
# libvirtd.service written to expect 4096 guests, so if we
# guess at 4 files per guest here that is 16k:

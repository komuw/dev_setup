# Note: This config does not work with tethered(via phone) wifi like safaricom.
# TODO: we should make it work.
# For now, when working with such connections, use the file `etc_systemd_network_tethered_internet_dns.network` instead
# TODO: We should unify that file and this one.
#       or be able to add the two; by making the match section to be super-specific

[Match]
# A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the device type, as exposed by `networkctl list`.
# Some valid values are "ether", "loopback", "wlan", "wwan".
# Alternatively, we could remove this setting and use `Name=*` so as to match all interfaces.
# You do not want to put `loopback` in here. see [3] above.
#
# `wlan` handles WIFI. `wwan` handles when tethering on phone wifi(like safaricom).
Type=wlan wwan

# NOTE: The config for the custom DNS below(ara.test) WORKs with this config
#       But it does NOT work with the `etc_systemd_network_tethered_internet_dns.network` config file.
#       TODO: we should fix that.
